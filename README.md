# Hey, My name is Samer Mahamid

I've graduated from "SoftUni" Software University in Bulgaria with a Vocational Diploma in Python Web Development
My skills are primarily focused on the Python language and especially on the Django framework, but I am also familiar with other programming languages or frameworks like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and SQL.
